## DataGate Web 

https://pharusdatagate.com <br />

![UserPanel](Documentation/Views/App/UserPanel.png)

An internal web application for managing more than 250 funds. <br />

★ Increased operational efficiency <br />
Dealing with separate teams, processes and data sets can be challenging <br />
and time-consuming [(Gartner)](https://wiki2.org/en/Business_intelligence#cite_note-blumberg-18). Having a single source of data will save users' <br />
time and increase team operational efficiency. <br />

★ Automate parts of the Risk and Legal department <br />

★ Efficient allocation management <br />
A full data view provides depth and detail - you can move <br />
from a library view to an individual asset level view.
