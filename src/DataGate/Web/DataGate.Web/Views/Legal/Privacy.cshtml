                            The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:<br />
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
                                Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
                                Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”),
                                without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
                                This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data 
                                is subject to European data protection law;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User 
                                and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the 
                                exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                            </li>

                            In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing,
                            and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement,
                            or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.<br />

                            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the
                            User's Data to a country other than their own.
                            To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred Data,
                            Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.<br />

                            Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers

                            such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br />

                            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
                            checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire

                            Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
                            required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br />

                            Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.<br />
                            In particular, Users have the right to do the following:<br />
                        </p>


                        @*Withdraw their consent at any time. Users have the right to withdraw consent where they 
                        have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.
                        Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object to the processing of 
                        their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent. 
                        Further details are provided in the dedicated section below.
                        Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, 
                        obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.
                        Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the accuracy 
                        of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.
                        Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right, under certain circumstances, 
                        to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process 
                        their Data for any purpose other than storing it.
                        Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed. Users have the right, under certain circumstances, 
                        to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.
                        Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller. Users have the right to receive 
                        their Data in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, 
                        if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. 
                        This provision is applicable provided that the Data is processed by automated means 
                        and that the processing is based on the User's consent, on a contract which the 
                        User is part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
                        Lodge a complaint. Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.
                        Details about the right to object to processing
                        Where Personal Data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official 
                        authority vested in the Owner or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, 
                        Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.

                        Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing
                        purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. 
                        To learn, whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, 
                        Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.

                        details provided in this document. These requests can be exercised free of charge and 
                        will be addressed by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month.
